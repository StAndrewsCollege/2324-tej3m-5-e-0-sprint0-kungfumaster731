Research
	• Some people have tried rolling the paper up diagonally
	• Others build tubing but they use tape so no
Ideation
	• Cut paper down the middle leaving a cm of paper left
	• Fold it up
	• Fold it over
	• And then fold it in the middle to create a support base
	• Cut a slit to cross the papers over
	• Repeat until no more support

Testing and Critique
	• Didn’t hold up
	• Fell down right away
	
Final Design



	• Fold paper vertically in half
	• Cut 90% all the way up
	• Fold that one side up towards the 10%
	• Fold vertically so its one paper
	• Cut slit so it holds
	• Fold top paper vertically again
	• Cut out from the right side some more paper
	• Fold up
	• Cut slit
	• Repeat
Conclusion
	• Reached 25 inches!!
	• Seems very successful
	• Although there is a slight lean at the top
	• Try to reinforce the folds between layers
